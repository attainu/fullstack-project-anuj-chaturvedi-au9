# Customizable_Portfolio
This is an __*Open Source Project*__ to make available basic structure of code to everyone, <br>
who wants to build an online portfolio to showcase their achievements &amp; strides towards making progress.

## Motivation
We the coding community, esp. **student coders**, are full of enthusiasm of learning new technologies everyday<br>
& do like to have a place where we could __*depict ourselves at professional fronts*__ full-fledgedly. <br>
Thus merely 1 page resume can't suffice the space everything additional we might want to show. For this and much more an online portfolio would come handy to express our true potential & interests.<br>
And thus, I proposed this project to be a __*Mentor*__ for PSoC.

## Why go for an online portfolio?
For Building an Online Presence: 
>
> - For Visibility to other professionals
> - While applying for Internships/ Jobs, to share your unique aura.
> - Leverage it showcase our coding projects or academic work in a more dynamic fashion
> - Or just having everything at one place to get self-motivated & keep progressing at a pace.
>
*Building a website about your brand and experience is a polished way to share your expertise with others*.
